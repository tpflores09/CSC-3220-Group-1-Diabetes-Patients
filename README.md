## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to show the progress of the group project for the CSC 3220 course. 
The project is to analyze the Diabetes Patients Dataset and to create a model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not in comparison to the actual dataset.
We used various imputation methods to fill in the missing values in the dataset and then tested the new dataset with various models to see which one would be the most accurate.
Our comparison variables to determine the efficiency of our model includes accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to measure the performance of the models in comparison to one another.
This project was a collaborative effort between the following members:
- Thomas D. Robertson
- Tania Perdomo Flores
- Logan Bolton
- Fengjun Han
- Kristian Obrusanszki

## Results
The progress and results of the project can be found in the pdf file: CSC-3220-Team-1-Diabetes-Final-Report

## Methods
The methods utilized in analysis include the following:
- Data Cleaning
- Data Imputation
- Data Analysis
- Model Creation
- Model Testing
- Model Comparison

## Scripts
The scripts used in the project can be found in the Analytics_scripts folder. The scripts include the following:

Logistic Regression Analysis using cluster Imputation - ClusterImputation_LogisticRegression.R

Logistic Regression Analysis with LASSO and SMOTE optimizations and MICE imputation replacement - MICE_Imputation_Logistic_Regression

SVM Analysis using clustering imputation - SVM_analysis.R

Decision Tree Classification - Classification Tree With ROC Curve.R

and various kmeans clustering scripts to test predictor variables.
